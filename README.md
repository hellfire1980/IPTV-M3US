Welcome to Bitsbb01's Github, i do a lot in IPTV and in process of setting up the best kodi package...


Looking for way and may need to write a script to pull all the streams from hlscat into a valid m3u with only the working streams daily. this is going to be my next project... unless someone's already created a script or kodi addon that pulls from hlscat... If you know how to do this, please let me know in the Discussions. 



** If anyone can provide the webgrab files for Cine Film and the MBC channels, then i'll include those in my epg. I havent found a working english version at all yet.. **

So i have an old version of Webgrab that still allows 1000+ epg's to be done, however the newest version of the webgrab only allows 250 at any time, so i'm looking to see how to convert the new site.ini's to work with the old version therefore allowing them to be included into it. Any ideas?
